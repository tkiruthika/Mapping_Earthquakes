# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

The overview of this module is to use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Delieverable 1
### Add Tectonic Plate Data

With the knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, we have added tectonic plate data using d3.json(), added the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and added the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

### Add Major Earthquake Data

With the knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, we have added major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(). We also added color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and added a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

## Delieverable 3
### Add an Additional Map

With the knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js we added a third map style to our earthquake map.
